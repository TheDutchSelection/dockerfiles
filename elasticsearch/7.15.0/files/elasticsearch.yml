# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: ${NODE_NAME}
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
# node.rack: r1
#
# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):
#
node.master: ${NODE_MASTER}
#
# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):
#
node.data: ${NODE_DATA}
#
# Allow this node to apply an ingest pipeline (enabled by default):
#
node.ingest: ${NODE_INGEST}
#
# Disable starting multiple nodes on a single system:
#
node.max_local_storage_nodes: ${MAX_LOCAL_STORAGE_NODES}
#
# Add by GM custom disk type
#
node.attr.disk: ${NODE_DISK_TYPE}
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: ${PATH_DATA}
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: ${PATH_LOGS}
#
# Path to snapshots:
#
path.repo: ${PATH_REPO}
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: ${HOST}
#
# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#
network.publish_host: ${PUBLISH_HOST}
#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: ${HTTP_PORT}
#
# TDS custom
http.max_content_length: 1gb
#
# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):
#
transport.tcp.port: ${TRANSPORT_PORT}
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ##unicast_hosts##
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes::  ##initial_master_nodes##
#
# For more information, consult the zen discovery module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
gateway.recover_after_nodes: ${MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_NODES}
#
# Expected number of nodes for the cluster
#
gateway.expected_nodes: ${EXPECTED_NUMBER_OF_NODES}
#
# Waiting time before starting recovery
#
gateway.recover_after_time: 5m
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
action.destructive_requires_name: ${REQUIRED_EXPLICIT_DESTRUCTIVE_NAMES}
#
# No automatic index creation
#
action.auto_create_index: ".watches,.triggered_watches,.watcher-history-*"
#
# Added by GM, default is 10000, which can be problematic
#
search.max_buckets: 999999999
#
